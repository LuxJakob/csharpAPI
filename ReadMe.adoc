= C# - ASP.NET Core Web API

== Overview
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my ASP.NET Core Web API project. 

This project is built using ASP.NET Core, a powerful framework for building cross-platform, high-performance web applications. The main focus here is on creating a robust Web API that can handle various requests and serve data efficiently.

Let's get startet!

== Dependencies
* Linux - Ubuntu 22.04
* .NET 6.0.124

== Installation
Installing the Software development kit:

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-6.0
    
# Confirming the correct version 
dotnet --list-sdks
dotnet --list-runtimes
----

== Getting Startet

For those eager to know, this application was created with
[source,shell]
----
# Change directory to project folder
dotnet new webapi -o ProjectName -f net6.0
----

Start by installing the dependencies and buildung/debugging the project
[source,shell]
----
# Change directory to project folder
dotnet build
----

After that, go ahead and run your project using the following command:
[source,shell]
----
dotnet run
----

And remember, the used ports will be displayed!


== Testing the REST API

First, take a look in your browser:

link:https://localhost:{PORT}/frogeworld[https://localhost:{PORT}/frogeworld]

You can also use Swagger for testing:

link:https://localhost:{PORT}/Swagger/index.html[https://localhost:{PORT}/Swagger/index.html]


To view results, you can install the .NET HTTP REPL command-line tool:
[source,shell]
----
dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.dotnet-httprepl
----

If the HttpRepl tool warns "Unable to find an OpenAPI description", the most likely cause is an untrusted development certificate. HttpRepl requires a trusted connection. Before you can continue, you must configure your system to trust the dev certificate with dotnet dev-certs https --trust

Following steps might help in this case!
[source,shell]
----
dotnet dev-certs https
sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
sudo update-ca-certificates
----

You can find more information on trusting the ASP.NET Core development certificate on this link:

Now, you can proceed to use HttpRepl:
[source,shell]
----
httprepl https://localhost:{PORT}
----


== Unit Tests

TEXT

[source,shell]
----
dotnet test
----

TEXT

== Docker
Wanna implement:

[source,shell]
----
docker build -t frogworld:1.0 .
----

== Curl
You can als use *curl* commands for CRUD operations:

=== GET
[source,shell]
----
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://localhost:7223/Frog' \
  -H 'accept: text/plain'

curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://localhost:7223/Frog/2' \
  -H 'accept: text/plain'
----

=== POST
[source,shell]
----
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://localhost:7223/Frog' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "id": 0,
  "name": "Froggy",
  "screamingCroak": true
}'
----

=== PUT
[source,shell]
----
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'https://localhost:7223/Frog/3' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "id": 3,
  "name": "Froggy",
  "screamingCroak": false
}'
----

=== DELETE
[source,shell]
----
curl -X 'DELETE' \
  'https://localhost:7223/Frog/3' \
  -H 'accept: */*'
----

Tough luck! ðŸ˜Š
